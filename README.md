# d8playground

## Authors Note
It's a playground for me.  !!!Don't trust it!!!  I'm going to push my sporadic tests here to see how well it works.  If it's broken it's probably *cough cough* Shiva's fault.

## Goals
As I said, don't trust it.  I just want to test a few D8 things here.  Some minor module development.  Some minor theme development.
